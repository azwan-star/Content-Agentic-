Here is the refined, linear User Flow for your Facebook-Only Content Engine.
This flow is designed to feel like a "Magic Button" for Facebook marketing.

🟢 Phase 1: Authentication
Goal: Secure access with zero friction.
Open App: User visits the web app URL.
Login: User enters email address.
Magic Link: User clicks the link in their email inbox.
Redirect: User is dropped directly onto the "Creator Studio" (Home) page.

🔵 Phase 2: The "Creator Studio" (Input)
Goal: Capture the idea and style preference in under 30 seconds.
Input Topic: User types their raw idea into the main text box.
Example: "We are offering a 20% discount on all winter coats this weekend."

Select Tone: User clicks a button to define the vibe.
Selection: "Exciting" (to make it hype).

Select Image Style: User selects a visual style from a dropdown.
Selection: "3D Illustration".

Action: User clicks the big "Draft Post" button.

Feedback: The button turns into a spinner/loading state: "AI is brainstorming & designing..."

⚫ Phase 3: The "Black Box" (System Processing)
Goal: Invisible automation (User waits ~45-60 seconds).
Frontend: Sends data (topic, tone, style, userId) to n8n Workflow A.
n8n:
Writes Caption: Uses GPT-4 to write a Facebook-optimized caption based on the Tone.
Generates Image: Uses DALL-E 3 to create a 3D Illustration based on the Topic.
Saves: Inserts the text and image URL into the Supabase Database with status ready.


Frontend: Receives a "Success" signal or polls the database until the new row appears.
Transition: Automatically redirects the user to the Review Page.

🔵 Phase 4: The "News Feed" Editor (Review)
Goal: Make the user feel like they are looking at a real Facebook post before it goes live.
Visual: User sees a UI card that looks exactly like a Facebook Mobile Post.
Profile Pic + Name at the top.
The AI-written text in the middle.
The AI-generated Image large and center.
Fake Like/Comment buttons at the bottom (for aesthetics).


Review:
The Text: User notices a typo or wants to add a specific link. They click the text and edit it directly (like a text editor).
The Image: User sees the 3D illustration. It looks good.


Decision:
Option A: Delete (Trash Icon) - If the AI completely missed the mark.
Option B: Post to Facebook (Primary Blue Button).



🟢 Phase 5: Publishing & Confirmation
Goal: Instant gratification.
Action: User clicks "Post to Facebook".
System:
App sends the specific Draft ID to n8n Workflow B.
n8n grabs the edited text and the image from the database.
n8n pushes it to the official Meta Graph API (Facebook Page).


Feedback:
Button shows "Publishing...".
Button turns Green: "Posted! ✅".


End: The card disappears or moves to a "History" tab, and the user is redirected back to the Creator Studio to make another post.

Summary of the Experience
Total Clicks: ~4 clicks (Type -> Select Tone -> Draft -> Post).
Total Time: ~2 minutes (including AI generation time).
User Feeling: "I just hired a professional social media manager who works instantly."
